        <b>The AMPds dataset</b> has been release to help <a href="http://nilm.ca">load disaggregation/NILM</a> and eco-feedback researcher test their algorithms, models, systems, and prototypes. This dataset is intended to be multi-year capture of the consumption of my house. 
        This dataset contains electricity, water, and natural gas measurements at one minute intervals. A total of 1,051,200 readings for 2 years of monitoring. Additionally, this new version has been fixed so that there are not missing readings and the <a href="https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues/32">water meter pulse reset problem</a>.</p>

        <p>More details about the house, meters uses, measurements taken, and how to get access to the dataset are described below (on this webpage) and in my <a href="EPEC_2013">research paper</a> (the below citation information).

        <p>
        We monitored a house built in 1955 in the greater Vancouver region in British Columbia (Canada), which underwent major renovations in 2005 and 2006-receiving a Canadian Government EnerGuide rating of 82%.

        Electricity measurements are taken by 2 DENT PowerScout 18 units metering 24 loads at the electrical circuit breaker panel. Measurements are read over a RS-485/Modbus communication link by data acquisition equipment. Natural gas measurements are taken by an Elster AC250 gas meter and a Elster BK-G4 gas meter; both send pulses to the data acquisition equipment. Water measurements are taken by 2 Elster/Kent V100 water meters, which also send pulses to the data acquisition equipment.

        <h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>How are timestamps used?</h3>
        <p>
        All data file rows begin with the timestamp integer value of <b>1333263600</b>. The house used in AMPds is in the <em>America/Vancouver</em> timezone. So the timestamp 1333263600 is equivalent to <b>April 01, 2012 12:00:00 AM (local time)</b> or <b>Apr 01, 2012 07:00:00 (GMT or UTC)</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>Where can I get weather data?</h3>
        <p>
        Historical weather data for this house can be downloaded from the Canada Wether Office's National Climate Data and Information Archive found <a href="http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?StationID=889">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you have more details about the HVAC system?</h3>
        <p>
        The house HVAC setup is often called a duel-fuel system, using forced air. Natural gas is used, but only when it is too cold. At about 2&deg;C (or 35.5&deg;F) there would be a change over from electric heating from the heat pump to gas heating from the central furnace. At that temperature there is not heat that the heat pump can give, it is a stain on the compressor. The FRG meter will have data for the furnace using gas. HPE is the breaker for the heat pump. FRE is the breaker for he furnace fan and thermostat. The gas furnace (where the fan is) is a 2-stage, variable speed fan forced air and is rated at 94% efficient.. The heat pump has a 2-stage compressor and is rated at 17 SEER. The heat pump is there central unit for air conditioning, there are not other air conditioning units in the house (besides the windows).
        </p>

        <h3>What appliances use natural gas?</h3>
        <p>
        Appliance that use natural gas in my house are: the furnace (FRG), the instant hot water unit, the cooking stove (not oven), and the fireplace (rarely used).
